        <p>
          I enjoy crosswords, and wrote these tools to help me. There are well over a quarter of a
          million words and phrases in the dictionary, thanks to
          <a href="http://www.crosswordman.com/">Ross Beresford</a>'s UKACD dictionary and a huge
          list of phrases from Ross Withey.

            If you're a regular user of this site, you'll probably notice some changes over the next
            few weeks. Please let me know if anything stops working for you, or if you prefer
            anything the way it was. &mdash;<a href="mailto:pete@petebevin.com">Pete</a>.

            Update 2: I really appreciate all the feedback, ideas, and problem reports! My top
            priority is fixing the site for people who can't use it. If search doesn't work for you
            at all, please let me know, and it will help me fix it faster if you also tell me what
            browser and device you're using (e.g., "Safari on Mac" or "Chrome on an Android phone").
            Also, I've made
            <a href="https://old.wordfun.ca/">the old version of the site</a> available while I sort
            this out.
          </p>

          <ul class="todo">
            <li><s>Search doesn't work at all for some people</s></li>
            <li><s>Anagram preview should show letters as typed, not sorted.</s></li>
            <li>
              Respect word boundaries better:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <s>
                    <kbd>s.e./.....</kbd> should match <kbd>see reason</kbd> but not
                    <kbd>see no evil</kbd>
                  </s>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <s><kbd>s.e......</kbd>should match both, and also <kbd>scenarios</kbd></s>
                </li>
                <li>Don't count apostrophes as word breaks</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Thesarus is overly pedantic about spaces (at the start, at the end, or in the middle!)
            </li>
            <li><s>Find anagrams with unknown letters</s></li>
            <li>Bring back the cryptogram solver!</li>
          </ul>
