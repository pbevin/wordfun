# Wordfun data files

This directory contains runtime files for the Wordfun server. The production version of Wordfun uses a more
extensive data set, but this is representative.

- `lexicon.txt` is a copy of Ross Beresford's UKACD18 dictionary.
- `extra-words` is a list of additions made to the lexicon over the years.
- `popular_words.txt` is a list of the not-quite-10,000 most popular English words. It is taken from the
  `google-10000-english-no-swears.txt` file in Josh Kaufman's [google-10000-english] repo.
